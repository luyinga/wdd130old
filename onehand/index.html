        <h1>Welcom to One Hand</h1>
        <p>One Hand is an organisation who is helping people who are drug addicted by giving them 
            advice and helping them stop using drugs. One hand is also helping people who are staying
            in the street by giving them clothes, food and anything they are in need, we are also 
            doing door to door to collect food, clothes, jackets, blankets and anything that can help 
            people so that we can give to the people who are in the street. We are there to give advice 
            to those people who are in the street and those who are using drugs so that they can get 
            out of the situation they are in and serve the community.
